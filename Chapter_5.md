# Chapter 5
## Proof Techniques

Here we will cover the three most importatn means of proving:
- Direct Proof (just do by intuition)
- Proof by Contradiction (show that the negation of the statement you wish to prove implies the impossible)
- Proof in cases (which may be used when conditions dictate that different situations occur). 

Some other ones are:
- proof by exhaustion (in calculus, its used the proof that something is true by showing that it is true for each and every case that could possibly be considered)

Example of Formal Proof:
Theorem 5.1 
If a, b, and c are integers such that a divides b and a divides c, then a divides b+c
