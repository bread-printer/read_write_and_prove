## Proof Techniques

Here we will cover the three most importatn means of proving:
    - Direct Proof (just do by intuition)
    - Proof by Contradiction (show that the negation of the statement you wish to prove implies the impossible)
    - Proof in cases (which may be used when conditions dictate that different situations occur).
