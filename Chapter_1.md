## Problems
1.3) Solve the following anagrams:
	a. NOVA CURVE -> ACENORVVU -> Vancouver
	b. NINE SLAP NAVY -> AAEILNNNPSY -> Pennsylvania
	c. I HELD A HIP PAL -> AAHHEDIILPP -> Philadelphia
	d. DIRTY ROOM -> DIMOORTY -> Dormitory
	
1.5) It is more likely to find the room door on the third try than the first one since on the third, the probabilistic sample space gets smaller after each iteration. 1/7 < 1/6 < 1/5 < ...

1.7) 
Given that we are looking for all points that are equidistant from the x-axis and yz-plane, we need to have points that have a distance from the x-axis that is equal to its distance from the YZ-plane. Then since the distance between x-axis and the yz plane are the same, this forms a triangle with two sides of distance n. Following the pythagorean theorem, n^2 + n^2 = 2n^2 so all this means that all the points must have a distance of sqrt(2) * n from the origin.

1.9) Since n is an odd integer, let x be an integer such that n = (x/2 + 1) where is x is a real number. Then by algebra: n^3 - n = (x/2 + 1)^3 - (x/2 +1) = ((x^3)/8 + (x^2)/2 + x/2 + (x^2)/4 + x + 1) - (x/2 + 1) = (x(x+3)(x+2))/8. Thus with no additional coefficients and since n is an odd integer, this becomes: ((n-1)(n+1)(n+2))/8. Since at least one of the numerators will be divisible by 3, this is divisible by 24.
